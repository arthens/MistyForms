TODO:
- translate all error messages to English
- add the prefix mf_* to all classes
- create a basic, phone friendly style for the form
- add support for translations (brr)
- add javascript validation
- add password field
- throw ConfigurationException if the handler is missing from the view
- would it make sense to add validators to let the user espress more complex requirements?
